# To-Do list
This project demonstrates basic web development skills including HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript interactivity.


Features
1) Add Tasks: Users can input a task in the text box and click the "Add" button to add the task to the list.

   
2) Mark Tasks as Completed: Users can click on any task in the list to toggle its completion status. Completed tasks are visually distinguished by a strikethrough and a different background color.


3) Persistent Storage: The app saves tasks to the user's browser using local storage. This ensures that tasks remain available even after the browser is closed and reopened.
